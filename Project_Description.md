Analysis for the genome of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SAR-CoV-2) using Python.

Analyzing the genome of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SAR-CoV-2) of a size "29903", where I calculated the GC-content for each gene. In addition to translating each gene to protein. Next, I computed the trinucleotides frequencies in the HIV genome. Finally, identifying the coding sequences (protein-coding) in the genome.
